# Label Studio PyInstaller

This repository contains hooks and `.spec` files to support building
Label Studio as a standalone executable.

Remember this involves a patch to the settings.version part of
label_studio.

Remember also that we installed 3.1.4 of gdal from conda-forge.

Remember we also made an `__init__.py` in the core.templatetags dir.

Remember we also patched for the git stuff.
